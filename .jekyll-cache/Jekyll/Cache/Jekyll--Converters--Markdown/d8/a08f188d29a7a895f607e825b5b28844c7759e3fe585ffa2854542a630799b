I"‘<p>I was just so tired of having only low intensity headlamps available to me, and as a student, the price of 140USD was just unbearable for a 800 lumen headlamp. And ofcourse, it is much more fun to make your own! It was intended to use it as a bike-light for afternoons in the forests with my mountainbike, but because of parts delay it wasnt finished before the snow claimed the forest trails.</p>
