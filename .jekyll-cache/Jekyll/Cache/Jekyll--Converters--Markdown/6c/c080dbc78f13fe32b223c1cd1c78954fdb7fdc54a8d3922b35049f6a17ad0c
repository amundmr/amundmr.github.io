I"U<p>This project started in the winter of 2017/2018, and I can safley say it has taken way too much time. In this Article I will walk you trough how I made it, and I will try to be structured so you can read individual sections by themselves. This electric mountainboard was made on an extreme budget, see parts list for price estimates.</p>
