I"L<p>Currently taking a Master of Science degree in <a href="https://www.uio.no/studier/program/materialvitenskap-master/">materials for energy and nanotechnology</a> at the University of Oslo. My master project is on cation substitution in the high voltage spinel cathode material LiNi<sub>0.5</sub>Mn<sub>1.5</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The aim is to stabilize the structure and improve cyclability.</p>

<p>On myspare time I like to do various projects, such as this website, or more practical things which you can find in the “posts” section. In addition to this I have a Trek Fuel EX 8 mountainbike which I really enjoy riding. “Nordmarka” is the local forest area, and I love exploring new areas either by bike or by foot.</p>
